# 🌩️ BTC Weather Radar

**Live Bitcoin price meets real-time weather radar.**  
Because obviously you need to know if it's raining *and* if BTC is dumping at the same time.

## 🧠 What is this?

**BTC Weather Radar** is a browser-based visual dashboard that blends:

- 📡 Real-time **weather radar visualization**
- ₿ Live **Bitcoin price data**
- 🌈 A bold, visual interface designed to feel like a terminal for chaos

It’s a weird mashup of meteorology + crypto monitoring, built as a fast, no-install web app.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌍 **Live Radar Map**  
  Animated radar tiles showing current weather patterns

- ₿ **Live BTC Price Feed**  
  Pulls Bitcoin pricing data and overlays it in real time

- 🎛️ **Minimal UI / Max Signal**  
  Clean, fast, and readable — designed for always-on display

- 📱 **Responsive Layout**  
  Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile

- ⚡ **Zero Backend**  
  Fully static front-end — runs entirely in the browser

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5 + CSS3**
- **Vanilla JavaScript**
- **Radar tile providers (weather map layers)**
- **Crypto price API (BTC/USD)**

No frameworks. No build step. No nonsense.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. Loads a radar tile layer from a weather radar provider  
2. Fetches Bitcoin price data from a public crypto API  
3. Renders both into a single unified UI overlay  
4. Updates data at intervals for live monitoring
